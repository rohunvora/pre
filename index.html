          <h1>DeGods Update #1 - The Presale</h1>
          <p><b>Date:</b> 9/22, 9AM Pacific Standard Time
            <br><b>Price:</b> 3 SOL
            <br><b>Access:</b> OG Gods & Bounty Gods
            <br> <b>Available Supply for Presale:</b> TBD (We will be <a href="https://forms.gle/6dwFYQA8J3hSNrFSA">conducting a survey</a> to determine how many DeGods the community
            wants to purchase.)
            <br><br>
            <p><b>Why 3 SOL?</b><br><br> Mostly just math. 33.3% of 3 SOL is 1 SOL. By starting at 3, we ensure that all paper hand bitch taxes will always be above 1 SOL. <br><br>People have a strong round number bias.
              <br><br>When we were modeling out the different mint prices to set, we realized this single variable could make a huge difference in the potential outcomes. The disincentives aren't strong enough to prevent paperhands at a lower value. (.333 of 2 SOL = .66 SOL) We will not be changing the price, but we understand if this is a potential reason for someone not joining the experiment. Please do not make any dumb financial decisions to get into this mint. <br><br><br>
            <b>When's public mint?</b> <br><br> As soon as humanly possible. <br><br>We still have to bug test & change things with our marketplace & the contracts that interact with the marketplace. We will not accept having a public mint without a marketplace at the same time. Not having a marketplace immediately after mint puts the community at hostage. This is easily the worst part about SOL mints right now.
            <br><br>
            To be totally transparent, we are only doing this presale because we want the people who have supported us the earliest
            to feel comfortable sharing the project. We hate that so many people are concerned that they won't be able to get a
            DeGod.
            </p>
